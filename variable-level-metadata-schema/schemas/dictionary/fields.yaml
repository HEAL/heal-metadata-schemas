title: HEAL Variable Level Metadata Fields
description: |
  Variable level metadata individual fields integrated into the variable level
  metadata object within the HEAL platform metadata service.

  !!! note "NOTE"

    Only `name` and `description` properties are required. 
    For categorical variables, `constraints.enum` and `encodings` (where applicable) properties are highly encouraged. 
    For studies using HEAL or other common data elements (CDEs), `standardsMappings` information is highly encouraged.
    `type` and `format` properties may be particularly useful for some variable types (e.g. date-like variables)

  format:
    title: Variable Format
    type: string
    description: |
      Indicates the format of the type specified in the `type` property. 
      Each format is dependent on the `type` specified. 
      For example: If `type` is "string", then see the [String formats](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/table-schema/#string). 
      If `type` is "date", "datetime", or "time", default format is ISO8601 formatting for those respective types (see details on ISO8601 format for [Date](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/table-schema/#date),
      [Datetime](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/table-schema/#datetime), 
      or [Time](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/table-schema/#time)) - If you want to specify a date-like variable using standard Python/C strptime syntax, see [here](#format-details-for-date-datetime-time-type-variables) for details. 
      See [here](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/table-schema/#types-and-formats) for more information about appropriate `format` values by variable `type`. 

      [Additional information]

      Date Formats (date, datetime, time `type` variable):
      
      A format for a date variable (`date`,`time`,`datetime`).  
      **default**: An ISO8601 format string.
      **any**: Any parsable representation of a date/time/datetime. The implementing library can attempt to parse the datetime via a range of strategies.

      **{PATTERN}**: The value can be parsed according to `{PATTERN}`,
      which `MUST` follow the date formatting syntax of 
      C / Python [strftime](http://strftime.org/) such as:

      - "`%Y-%m-%d` (for date, e.g., 2023-05-25)"
      - "`%Y%-%d` (for date, e.g., 20230525) for date without dashes"
      - "`%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S` (for datetime, e.g., 2023-05-25T10:30:45)"
      - "`%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ` (for datetime with UTC timezone, e.g., 2023-05-25T10:30:45Z)"
      - "`%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z` (for datetime with timezone offset, e.g., 2023-05-25T10:30:45+0300)"
      - "`%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M` (for datetime without seconds, e.g., 2023-05-25T10:30)"
      - "`%Y-%m-%dT%H` (for datetime without minutes and seconds, e.g., 2023-05-25T10)"
      - "`%H:%M:%S` (for time, e.g., 10:30:45)"
      - "`%H:%M:%SZ` (for time with UTC timezone, e.g., 10:30:45Z)"
      - "`%H:%M:%S%z` (for time with timezone offset, e.g., 10:30:45+0300)"

      String formats:

      - "`email` if valid emails (e.g., test@gmail.com)"
      - "`uri` if valid uri addresses (e.g., https://example.com/resource123)"
      - "`binary` if a base64 binary encoded string (e.g., authentication token like aGVsbG8gd29ybGQ=)"
      - "`uuid` if a universal unique identifier also known as a guid (eg., f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479)"


      Geopoint formats:

      The two types of formats for `geopoint` (describing a geographic point).

      - `array` (if 'lat,long' (e.g., 36.63,-90.20))
      - `object` (if {'lat':36.63,'lon':-90.20})

  constraints:
    type: object
    properties:

        title: Maximum Length
        description: |
          Indicates the maximum length of an iterable (e.g., array, string, or
          object). For example, if 'Hello World' is the longest value of a
          categorical variable, this would be a maxLength of 11.

      enumJsonSpec:
        title: Variable Possible Values
        description: |
          Constrains possible values to a set of values.

        type: array
        examples:
         - [1,2,3,4]
         - ["White","Black or African American","American Indian or Alaska Native","Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander","Asian","Some other race","Multiracial"]

        $ref: "#/definitions/csvArray"
        examples: 
        - 1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8
        - White|Black or African American|American Indian or Alaska Native|Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander|Asian|Some other race|Multiracial
      pattern:
        type: string
        title: Regular Expression Pattern

          A regular expression pattern the data MUST conform to.
          
      maximum:
        type: integer

        description: |
          Specifies the maximum value of a field (e.g., maximum -- or most
          recent -- date, maximum integer etc). Note, this is different then
          maxLength property.

      minimum:
        type: integer
        title: Minimum Value
        description: |
          Specifies the minimum value of a field.

  encodingsJsonSpec:
    title: 'Variable Value Encodings (i.e., mappings; value labels)'
    description: |
      Variable value encodings provide a way to further annotate any value within a any variable type,
      making values easier to understand. 

      
      Many analytic software programs (e.g., SPSS,Stata, and SAS) use numerical encodings and some algorithms
      only support numerical values. Encodings (and mappings) allow categorical values to be stored as
      numerical values.
      
      Additionally, as another use case, this field provides a way to
      store categoricals that are stored as  "short" labels (such as
      abbreviations).

    type: object
    examples: 
      - {"0":"No","1":"Yes"}
      - {"HW":"Hello world","GBW":"Good bye world","HM":"Hi, Mike"}
  encodingsCsvSpec:

  ordered:
    title: An ordered variable
    description: |
      Indicates whether a categorical variable is ordered. This variable  is
      relevant for variables that have an ordered relationship but not
      necessarily  a numerical relationship (e.g., Strongly disagree < Disagree
      < Neutral < Agree).
