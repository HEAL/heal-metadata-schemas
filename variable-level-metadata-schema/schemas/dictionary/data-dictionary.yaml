      The version of the schema used in agreed upon convention of major.minor.path (e.g., 1.0.2) 
      
      NOTE: This is NOT for versioning of each indiviual data dictionary instance. 
      Rather, it is the
      version of THIS schema document. See `version` property (below) if specifying the individual data dictionary instance
      version.

      If generating a vlmd document as a csv file, include this version in 
      every row/record to indicate this is a schema level property 
      (not applicable for the json version as this property is already at the schema/root level)
