# Variable Level Metadata (Data Dictionaries) 

_version 0.2.0_

This schema defines the variable level metadata for one data dictionary for a given study.Note a given study can have multiple data dictionaries.

## `title` _(string,required)_

## `description` _(string)_

## `schemaVersion` _(string)_
The version of the schema used in agreed upon convention of major.minor.path (e.g., 1.0.2) 

NOTE: This is NOT for versioning of each indiviual data dictionary instance. 
Rather, it is the
version of THIS schema document. See `version` property (below) if specifying the individual data dictionary instance
version.

If generating a vlmd document as a csv file, include this version in 
every row/record to indicate this is a schema level property 
(not applicable for the json version as this property is already at the schema/root level)

## `version` _(string)_
The specified individual data dictionary instance version.
## `standardsMappings` _(array)_
A set of standardized instruments linked to all variables within the `fields` property (but see note).

!!! note "NOTE"

  If `standardsMappings` is present at both the root (this property) and within `fields`, 
  then the `fields` `standardsMappings` property takes precedence.

  Note, only instrument can be mapped to this property as opposed to the `fields` `standardsMappings`
  This property has the same specification as the `fields` `standardsMappings` to make the cascading logic
  easier to understand in the same way other standards implement cascading 
  (e.g., `missingValues` in the [frictionless specification](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/patterns/#missing-values-per-field))

## `custom` _(object)_
Additional properties not included as a core property. 

## `fields` _(array,required)_



!!! note "Highly encouraged"

  - Only `name` and `description` properties are required. 
  - For categorical variables, `constraints.enum` and `enumLabels` (where applicable) properties are highly encouraged. 
  - For studies using HEAL or other common data elements (CDEs), `standardsMappings` information is highly encouraged.
  - `type` and `format` properties may be particularly useful for some variable types (e.g. date-like variables)

### Properties for each `fields` record

**`schemaVersion`** _(string)_
 The version of the schema used in agreed upon convention of major.minor.path (e.g., 1.0.2) 

NOTE: This is NOT for versioning of each indiviual data dictionary instance. 
Rather, it is the
version of THIS schema document. See `version` property (below) if specifying the individual data dictionary instance
version.

If generating a vlmd document as a csv file, include this version in 
every row/record to indicate this is a schema level property 
(not applicable for the json version as this property is already at the schema/root level)

Examples:


```
  1.0.0

```

```
  0.2.0

```

**`section`** _(string)_
 The section, form, survey instrument, set of measures  or other broad category used 
to group variables. Previously called "module."

Examples:


```
  Demographics

```

```
  PROMIS

```

```
  Medical History

```

**`name`** _(string,required)_
 The name of a variable (i.e., field) as it appears in the data. 

Examples:


```
  gender_id

```

**`title`** _(string)_
 The human-readable title or label of the variable.

Examples:


```
  Gender identity

```

**`description`** _(string,required)_
 An extended description of the variable. This could be the definition of a variable or the 
question text (e.g., if a survey). 

Examples:


```
  The participant's age at the time of study enrollment

```

```
  What is the highest grade or level of school you have completed or the highest degree you have received?

```

**`type`** _(string)_
 A classification or category of a particular data element or property expected or allowed in the dataset.

Must be one of: `number`, `integer`, `string`, `any`, `boolean`, `date`, `datetime`, `time`, `year`, `yearmonth`, `duration`, `geopoint`

**`format`** _(string)_
 Indicates the format of the type specified in the `type` property. 
Each format is dependent on the `type` specified. 
See [here](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/table-schema/#types-and-formats) 
for more information about appropriate `format` values by variable `type`.


**`constraints`** _(object)_
 


- **`required`** _(boolean)_
     If this variable is marked as true, then this variable's value must be present
    (ie not missing; see missingValues). If marked as false or not present, then the 
    variable CAN be missing.



- **`maxLength`** _(integer)_
     Indicates the maximum length of an iterable (e.g., array, string, or
    object). For example, if 'Hello World' is the longest value of a
    categorical variable, this would be a maxLength of 11.



- **`enum`** _(array)_
     Constrains possible values to a set of values.

    Examples:


    ```json

      [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

    ```

    ```json

      ['Poor', 'Fair', 'Good', 'Very good', 'Excellent']

    ```


- **`pattern`** _(string)_
     A regular expression pattern the data MUST conform to.



- **`maximum`** _(integer)_
     Specifies the maximum value of a field (e.g., maximum -- or most
    recent -- date, maximum integer etc). Note, this is different then
    maxLength property.



- **`minimum`** _(integer)_
     Specifies the minimum value of a field.



**`enumLabels`** _(object)_
 Variable value encodings provide a way to further annotate any value within a any variable type,
making values easier to understand. 


Many analytic software programs (e.g., SPSS,Stata, and SAS) use numerical encodings and some algorithms
only support numerical values. Encodings (and mappings) allow categorical values to be stored as
numerical values.

Additionally, as another use case, this field provides a way to
store categoricals that are stored as  "short" labels (such as
abbreviations).

This field is intended to follow [this pattern](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/patterns/#table-schema-enum-labels-and-ordering)

Examples:


```json

  {'1': 'Poor', '2': 'Fair', '3': 'Good', '4': 'Very good', '5': 'Excellent'}

```

```json

  {'HW': 'Hello world', 'GBW': 'Good bye world', 'HM': 'Hi, Mike'}

```

**`enumOrdered`** _(boolean)_
 Indicates whether a categorical variable is ordered. This variable  is
relevant for variables that have an ordered relationship but not
necessarily  a numerical relationship (e.g., Strongly disagree < Disagree
< Neutral < Agree).

This field is intended to follow the ordering aspect of this [this pattern][this pattern](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/patterns/#table-schema-enum-labels-and-ordering)


**`missingValues`** _(array)_
 A list of missing values specific to a variable.

Examples:


```json

  ['Missing', 'Skipped', 'No preference']

```

```json

  ['Missing']

```

**`trueValues`** _(array)_
 For boolean (true) variable (as defined in type field), this field allows
a physical string representation to be cast as true (increasing
readability of the field). It can include one or more values.

Examples:


```json

  ['required', 'Yes', 'Checked']

```

```json

  ['required']

```

**`falseValues`** _(array)_
 For boolean (false) variable (as defined in type field), this field allows
a physical string representation to be cast as false (increasing
readability of the field) that is not a standard false value. It can include one or more values.

Examples:


```json

  ['Not required', 'NOT REQUIRED']

```

```json

  ['No']

```

**`custom`** _(object)_
 Additional properties not included a core property. 


**`standardsMappings`** _(array)_
 
A set of instrument and item references to standardized data elements designed to document
the [HEAL common data elements program](https://heal.nih.gov/data/common-data-elements)
and other standardized/common element sources to facilitate cross-study comparison and interoperability
of data. One can either map an individual data element or an instrument in which the field is 
a part of.

__**All Fields Mapped (Both Instrument and Item)**__

```json
"standardsMappings": [
    {
        "instrument": {
            "url": "https://www.heal.nih.gov/files/CDEs/2023-05/adult-demographics-cdes.xlsx",
            "source": "heal-cde",
            "title": "adult-demographics",
            "id": "5141"
        },
        "item": {
            "url": "https://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CDISC/SDTM/SDTM%20Terminology.html#CL.C74457.RACE",
            "source": "CDISC",
            "id": "C74457"
        }
    }
]
```

__**Only Instrument Title of Form CDE File Mapped**__

In this scenario, especially as CDE variables do not have associated CDISC ids listed, only instrument information is given.

```json
"standardsMappings": [
    {
        "instrument": {
            "source": "heal-cde",
            "title": "Adult demographics"
        }
    }
]
```

__**Only Instrument ID of HEAL CDE Mapped**__

```json
"standardsMappings": [
    {
        "instrument": {
            "source": "heal-cde",
            "id": "5141"
        }
    }
]
```

__**Other Non-HEAL CDE Use Cases**__

Only item matched (for example if found in the NIH (not HEAL) CDE repository). Folks would enter the information in the "Identifier" section. Similar to the above, they could also just enter the "url".

```json
"standardsMappings": [
    {
        "item": {
            "source": "NLM",
            "id": "Fakc6Jy2x"
        }
    }
]
```

__**Multiple CDE Mappings**__

Two separate records. If desired, multiple standard mappings can be entered, say from the NIH HEAL CDE repo and the NIH CDE lookup (NLM) by way of two separate records in the list.

```json
"standardsMappings": [
    {
        "instrument": {
            "source": "heal-cde",
            "title": "Adult demographics"
        },
        "item": {
            "source": "CDISC",
            "id": "C74457"
        },
    },
    {
        "item": {
            "source": "NLM",
            "id": "Fakc6Jy2x"
        }
    }
]
```


**`relatedConcepts`** _(array)_
 __**[Under development]**__ Mappings to a published set of concepts related to the given field such as 
ontological information (eg., NCI thesaurus, bioportal etc)
