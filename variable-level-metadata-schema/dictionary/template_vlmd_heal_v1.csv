description,"The name of a variable (i.e., field) as it appears in the data.
",The human-readable title of the variable.,An extended description of the variable.,"A classification allowing the user (analyst, researcher or computer) to know how to use the variable
","Indicates the format of the type specified in the `type` property. This may describe the type of unit (such as for time fields like year or month) or the format of a date field (such as %y%m%d).
","Indicates the maximum length of an iterable (e.g., array, string, or object). For example, if 'Hello World' is the longest value of a categorical variable, this would be a maxLength of 11.
","Constrains possible values to a set of values.
","A regular expression pattern the data MUST conform to.
","Specifies the maximum value of a field (e.g., maximum -- or most recent -- date, maximum integer etc). Note, this is different then maxLength property.
","Encodings (and mappings) allow categorical values to be stored as numerical values. Many analytic software programs use numerical encodings and some algorithms only support numerical values. Additionally, this field provides a way to store categoricals that are stored as  ""short"" labels (such as abbreviations)
","Indicates whether a categorical variable is ordered. This variable  is relevant for variables that have an ordered relationship but not necessarily  a numerical relationship (e.g., Strongly disagree < Disagree < Neutral < Agree).
",A list of missing values specific to a variable.,"For boolean (true) variable (as defined in type field), this field allows a physical string representation to be cast as true (increasing readability of the field)
","For boolean (false) variable (as defined in type field), this field allows a physical string representation to be cast as false (increasing readability of the field)
","A link to the variable as it exists on the home repository, if applicable
